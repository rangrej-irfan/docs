title: Governed Data Stewardship (GDS)
---


Your organization needs a flexible, collaborative solution to data governance problems such as the following:

* A centralized team building new products that stretch across multiple technological domains and datasets.

* A consumer-oriented group developing a data mesh composed of a large number of data sources and formats.

* Implementation of a bronze/silver/gold pattern for data access and use depending on specific needs.

* Data scientists building out new models for analytics or other needs.

Privacera Governed Data Stewardship's flexible architecture can enforce a separation of data, access control, and compliance adaptable to your data governance project needs.

The fundamental purposes of Privacera Governed Data Stewardship are to:

* Subdivide your data into fine-grained data domains of cloud applications that have your data.

* Create shared datasets based on those data domains.

* Define data owners and optional data stewards for those shared datasets and data domains.

* Control access by users, groups, and roles to data domains and shared datasets.

Privacera Governed Data Stewardship is based on PrivaceraCloud features such as resource policies, access policies, and permissions.

* Your account administrator sets up the basic PrivaceraCloud building blocks: connected applications and users.

* After these building blocks are available, Privacera Governed Data Stewardship simplifies and streamlines data governance, automatically creating policies and permissions as identified data owners define data domains and shared datasets.
