## PrivaceraCloud - Remote Access Support

This feature allows Privacera Support to provide assistance by accessing your account as an authorized user, with the same role as the authorizing user. Privacera Support will not view or access information in individual accounts unless requested. For configuration changes or policy definitions, administrators may enable time-limited remote access by requesting a token, valid for 24 hours and revocable at any time.

**Steps to Initiate Remote Access:**

1. Open the username menu (upper right navigation bar).
2. Under "Need Help?", click **Contact Privacera Support**.
3. Click **GENERATE TOKEN FOR PRIVACERA SUPPORT**.
4. Provide the six-digit support token to Privacera Support securely.
5. The username menu updates to show a support token is active, with options to **Terminate** or **Show Token List**.
6. Use **Terminate** to revoke the token at any time.
7. **Show Token List** displays active and inactive tokens, allowing you to revoke any active tokens.
