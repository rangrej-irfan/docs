# Access Management Integrations

Privacera offers three primary integration mechanisms to enforce permissions across various data sources efficiently.
These mechanisms ensure that data governance and security policies are seamlessly applied, providing robust protection
and compliance. 

![Access Connector Architecture](../../../images/access_management_architecture.png)

The detailed descriptions of these mechanisms are as follows:

## Apache Ranger Plugin

**Overview**:
The Apache Ranger Plugin is a lightweight Java library embedded within the compute environment of the data source. It
enforces security policies in real-time and provides centralized auditing capabilities.

**Key Features**:

- **Real-Time Policy Enforcement**: The plugins enforce policies as data access requests are made, ensuring immediate
  and up-to-date protection.
- **Embedded Integration**: Being embedded within the data source's compute environment, these plugins offer seamless
  integration and minimal performance overhead.
- **Centralized Auditing**: Audit logs generated by the plugins are sent to a central audit service, enabling
  comprehensive monitoring and compliance reporting.
- **Versatility**: This mechanism is versatile and supports various data sources and platforms, enhancing its
  applicability across different environments.

**How It Is Done**:

- **Plugin Deployment**: Lightweight Java plugins are deployed within the compute environment of the data source.
- **Policy Retrieval**: These plugins retrieve security policies from the Privacera platform or a Ranger admin service.
- **Real-Time Enforcement**: As data access requests are made, the plugins enforce the relevant policies in real-time.
- **Auditing**: The plugins generate audit logs for each access request, which are sent to a central audit service for
  monitoring and reporting purposes.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Policies can be updated dynamically without downtime, as the plugins continuously check for
  policy updates.

## Privacera PolicySync

**Overview**:
Privacera PolicySync is designed to manage and enforce policies across different data sources and applications which
have strong native enforcement capabilities. This mechanism involves defining policies within the Privacera platform
and then pushing these policies down to the native systems of the data sources.

**Key Features**:

- **Centralized Policy Management**: Policies are defined once within the Privacera platform and then propagated to
  various data sources, ensuring consistency and reducing administrative overhead.
- **Native Enforcement**: Once policies are pushed to the data source, they are enforced by the data source's native
  system, leveraging its inherent security capabilities.
- **Scalability**: This mechanism is scalable and suitable for large environments with numerous databases, ensuring
  efficient policy management and enforcement across the board.
- **Common Use Cases**: It is commonly used for databases like Snowflake, RedShift DB and applications like AWS Lake
  Formation and Databricks Unity Catalog

**How It Is Done**:

- **Policy Definition**: Administrators define access control policies within the Privacera platform.
- **Policy Distribution**: Privacera PolicySync pushes these policies to the respective data sources.
- **Native System Enforcement**: The data source's native security system enforces the policies. This ensures that
  access control is managed using the data source’s inherent security mechanisms.
- **Policy Updates**: Any changes to the policies in Privacera are automatically synchronized with the data sources,
  ensuring up-to-date enforcement.
- **Auditing**: Audit logs are pulled from the data sources and sent to the Privacera platform for centralized
  monitoring and reporting.


There are three primary activities involved in the Privacera PolicySync mechanism:

### **1. Reconciliation Check on Regular Interval**

The reconciliation check ensures that user identities and policies are consistently updated and synchronized between the
Privacera platform, the Privacera Connector, and the data sources.

**Steps**:

- **Pull Corporate User Identities**: The Privacera Connector periodically pulls user identities from the Privacera Platform.
  - **Retrieve Data Source User Identities**: It then retrieves user identities from the data sources.
  - **Pull Policies**: The connector pulls policies from both the Privacera Platform and the data sources.
  - **Reconcile Policies**: The connector reconciles these policies.
  - **Apply Changes**: It applies any necessary changes (grants/revokes) to the data sources.
  - **Native System Enforcement**: Policies are enforced by the data source's native system.

    PrivaceraConnector->>PrivaceraPlatform: Pull corporate user identities (regular interval)
    PrivaceraPlatform-->>PrivaceraConnector: Return users, groups, roles
    PrivaceraConnector->>DataSource: Pull data source user identities (regular interval)
    DataSource-->>PrivaceraConnector: Return users, groups, roles

    PrivaceraConnector->>PrivaceraPlatform: Pull policies in Privacera (regular interval)
    PrivaceraPlatform-->>PrivaceraConnector: Return policies
    PrivaceraConnector->>DataSource: Pull policies in data source (regular interval)
    DataSource-->>PrivaceraConnector: Return policies

    PrivaceraConnector->>PrivaceraConnector: Reconcile policies
    PrivaceraConnector->>DataSource: Apply delta grant/revoke to data source
    Note right of DataSource: Native System Enforcement
```

### **2. Admin Updating Policies**

This process involves an administrator updating access control policies within the Privacera platform. The updates are
then synchronized with the data sources to ensure policies are current.

**Steps**:

1. **Admin Updates Policies**: The admin updates policies in the Privacera Platform.
2. **Pull Updated Policies**: The Privacera Connector periodically pulls these updated policies.
3. **Distribute Policies**: The updated policies are then pushed to the data sources.
4. **Native System Enforcement**: The data source’s native system enforces the updated policies.

```mermaid

    participant Admin
    participant PrivaceraPlatform
    participant PrivaceraConnector
    participant DataSource

    Admin->>PrivaceraPlatform: Update policies
    PrivaceraConnector->>PrivaceraPlatform: Pull updated policies (regular interval)
    PrivaceraPlatform-->>PrivaceraConnector: Return updated policies
    PrivaceraConnector->>DataSource: Push updated policies
    Note right of DataSource: Native System Enforcement
```

### **3. Pulling Audits on Regular Interval**

The audit logs are periodically pulled from the data sources and normalize to Apache Ranger audit format and sent to the Privacera Platform, enabling 
centralized monitoring and reporting of access activities.

**Steps**:

1. **Pull Audit Logs**: The Privacera Connector periodically pulls audit logs from the data sources.
2. **Log Access Requests and Actions**: Acecss audit logs are normalized to Apache Ranger audit format and sent to the Privacera Platform.
3. **Centralized Monitoring and Reporting**: The Privacera Platform provides centralized monitoring and reporting of these logs for the admin.

```mermaid

    participant PrivaceraConnector
    participant DataSource

    PrivaceraConnector->>DataSource: Pull audit logs (regular interval)
    DataSource-->>PrivaceraConnector: Return audit logs
    PrivaceraConnector->>PrivaceraPlatform: Log access requests and actions
    PrivaceraPlatform-->>Admin: Centralized monitoring and reporting
```
