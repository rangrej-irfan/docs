# Access Tools

When Privacera is integrated with a data source, it generally supports all the tools that are natively supported by that
data source. Examples of these tools include the native console of the data source, JDBC, ODBC, and various BI tools.
However, there may be some limitations on the tools that can be used in certain cases.

For instance, with AWS S3 and other object storage systems, the native console is not available for direct access. In
such cases, the Privacera Portal provides a file explorer tool that can be used to access the data. This ensures that
users can still manage and interact with their data securely and efficiently, even when native tools are not supported.
