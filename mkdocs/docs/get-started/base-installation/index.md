# Base Installation of Privacera 
Privacera software deployment consists of a base installation which is common
across all the data-source connectors. The base installation provides the web
user-interface and policy store used by Privacera. After the base installation 
is complete, you can install the connectors for the data sources you want to 
do sensitive data-discovery, manage the access or encrypt the data.

The base installation is different for the different deployment options of Privacera.
