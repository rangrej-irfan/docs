# Base Installation of Privacera 
Privacera software deployment consists of a base installation which is common
across all the data-source connectors. The base installation provides the web
user-interface, policy store and audit store used by Privacera. After the base installation 
is complete, you can setup and configure the connectors for the data sources you want to 
do sensitive data-discovery, manage the access or encrypt the data.

The base installation is different for the different deployment options of Privacera. Select the deployment option you 
are interested in to get the installation instructions.
