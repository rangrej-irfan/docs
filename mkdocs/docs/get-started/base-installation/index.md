# Base Installation of Privacera 

Privacera software installation consists of two steps - the base installation and the data-source connectors installation.

Depending on the deployment option you choose, the base installation steps will vary. The goal of base installation 
is to give you access to the management user-interface and set up the policy store and audit store.

In case of PrivaceraCloud, the base installation consists of creating an account in PrivaceraCloud.

In case of Self-managed deployment, the base installation consists of using Privacera Manager software to install 
the Privacera software in your cloud provider VPC.

In case of PrivaceraCloud Data-plane, the base installation consists of creating an account in PrivaceraCloud
and then using Privacera Manager to install the Privacera software in your cloud provider VPC and establish the
connectivity to PrivaceraCloud. In addition to this, if you plan on using Privacera Discovery module, then it is 
installed as part of the base installation.

After the base installation steps are done you are ready to start deploying the data-source connectors that will be used
to do sensitive data-discovery, manage the access or encrypt the data.

The base installation is different for the different deployment options of Privacera. Select the deployment option you 
are interested in to get the installation instructions.
