the Privacera Manager image tag and download URL base-path.

```bash
cd ~/privacera/privacera-manager
cp config/sample.vars.privacera.yml config/vars.privacera.yml 

vi config/vars.privacera.yml

# Give a short user-friendly name for your installation that follows these rules, 
# - contain at most 63 characters
# - contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters or '-'
# - start with an alphanumeric character
# - end with an alphanumeric character
# It will be visible in Privacera Portal and will be used as a namespace in Kubernetes.
DEPLOYMENT_ENV_NAME: "privacera-dev"

privacera_hub_user: "<PRIVACERA_HUB_USER>"
privacera_hub_password: "<PRIVACERA_HUB_PASSWORD>"

# this should be only the IMAGE_TAG out of HUB_HOST/IMAGE_NAME:IMAGE_TAG
PRIVACERA_IMAGE_TAG: "<PRIV_MGR_IMAGE_TAG>"

# only the download URL without the file name privacera-manager.tar.gz, example: https://<domain>/<filepath>
PRIVACERA_BASE_DOWNLOAD_URL: "<PRIV_MGR_BASE_URL>"
```
