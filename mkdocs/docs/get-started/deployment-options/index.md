  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing sensitive data to remain within their control while leveraging Privaceraâ€™s
  managed services.
- **Compliance and Security:** Benefit from Privacera's robust security practices and compliance certifications,
  ensuring your data governance needs are met with the highest standards.

### 2. Self-Managed

The Self-Managed deployment option allows organizations to run the entire Privacera platform within their own Virtual
Private Cloud (VPC). This approach provides complete control over the deployment, configuration, and management of
Privacera, offering maximum flexibility and customization.

**Key Features:**

- **Full Control:** Organizations maintain full control over their infrastructure, data, and governance policies,
  allowing for customized configurations and optimizations.
- **Cloud:** Deploy Privacera within any cloud provider's VPC, aligning with your existing infrastructure and IT strategies.
- **Data Security:** All components, including control plane, connectors and the Discovery module, operate within the organization's
  VPC, ensuring sensitive data never leaves their controlled environment.
- **Customization:** Tailor the deployment to meet specific security, compliance, and operational requirements unique to
  your organization.

By offering both PrivaceraCloud and Self-Managed deployment options, Privacera provides the flexibility to choose the
best approach for your organization's data governance and security needs, whether you prefer a fully managed service or
