### 2. Self-Managed

The Self-Managed deployment option allows organizations to run the entire Privacera platform within their own Virtual
Private Cloud (VPC). This approach provides complete control over the deployment, configuration, and management of
Privacera, offering maximum flexibility and customization.

**Key Features:**

- **Full Control:** Organizations maintain full control over their infrastructure, data, and governance policies,
  allowing for customized configurations and optimizations.
- **Cloud:** Deploy Privacera within any cloud provider's VPC, aligning with your existing infrastructure and IT
  strategies.
- **Data Security:** All components, including control plane, connectors and the Discovery module, operate within the
  organization's
  VPC, ensuring sensitive data never leaves their controlled environment.
- **Customization:** Tailor the deployment to meet specific security, compliance, and operational requirements unique to
  your organization.

```
    
    
### 3. PrivaceraCloud Data-plane

The Data-plane deployment option gives you best of both the deployment options listed above. You get to use the
PrivaceraCloud to manage the data governance and security policies, and audit-store, and some components that 
access your data-sources are deployed in your cloud provider VPC, thereby ensuring that your data never leaves 
your cloud provider VPC.

**Key Features:**

- **Compliance and Security:** None of your data leaves your cloud provider VPC.
- **Credentials for Data-Sources:** All the credentials for the data-sources are stored within your cloud provider VPC.
- **Managed Service**: PrivaceraCloud provides the infrastructure, maintenance and update, high availability and
  reliability for managing your data governance and security policies as well as audit information.
