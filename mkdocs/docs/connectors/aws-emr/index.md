# EMR - Access Control

## Overview

Amazon EMR [(Amazon Elastic MapReduce)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html){:target="_blank"} is an cloud-based platform service that is designed for the effective scaling and
processing of large-volume datasets. It facilitates the users in quickly setting up, configuring, and scaling
virtual server clusters for analyzing and processing vast amounts of data efficiently. EMR supports a wide range of
open-source big data frameworks, including Hadoop, Spark, Hive and Trino giving users the flexibility to choose the
tools that best fit their needs.
